          The tickets for Touch events are non-refundable under any
          circumstances except for the listed below:

        <p class="policy__text normal">
          - Badly injury that will make it impossible for the customer to attend
          the event

          In these cases, the customer should send a detailed explanation of the
          reason for the refund with the document signed by the doctor and
          sealed with the respective clinic to <span>info@touch.ge</span> not
          later than 1 week before the event starts.

        <p class="policy__text normal">
          If the customer does not attend the event, Touch will not do a refund
          or return any tickets. This is the customer’s choice to skip the event
          and the event organisers cannot change the event budget in case of the
          guest no-show, because the event is planned in advance.
